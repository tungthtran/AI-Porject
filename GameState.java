     * You will implement this constructor. It will

     * state.getXExtent() and state.getYExtent(): get the map dimensions
     * state.getAllResourceIDs(): returns the IDs of all of the obstacles in the map
     * state.getResourceNode(int resourceID): Return a ResourceView for the given ID
     *
     * For a given ResourceView you can query the position using
     * resource.getXPosition() and resource.getYPosition()
     * 
     * You can get a list of all the units belonging to a player with the following command:
     * state.getUnitIds(int playerNum): gives a list of all unit IDs beloning to the player.
     * You control player 0, the enemy controls player 1.
     * 
     * In order to see information about a specific unit, you must first get the UnitView
     * corresponding to that unit.
     * state.getUnit(int id): gives the UnitView for a specific unit
     * 
     * With a UnitView you can find information about a given unit
     * unitView.getXPosition() and unitView.getYPosition(): get the current location of this unit
     * unitView.getHP(): get the current health of this unit
     * 
     * SEPIA stores information about unit types inside TemplateView objects.
     * For a given unit type you will need to find statistics from its Template View.
     * unitView.getTemplateView().getRange(): This gives you the attack range
     * unitView.getTemplateView().getBasicAttack(): The amount of damage this unit type deals
     * unitView.getTemplateView().getBaseHealth(): The initial amount of health of this unit type

     * 
     * It may be useful to be able to create a SEPIA Action. In this assignment you will
     * deal with movement and attacking actions. There are static methods inside the Action
     * class that allow you to create basic actions:
     * Action.createPrimitiveAttack(int attackerID, int targetID): returns an Action where
     * the attacker unit attacks the target unit.
     * Action.createPrimitiveMove(int unitID, Direction dir): returns an Action where the unit
     * moves one space in the specified direction.
     *
     * You may find it useful to iterate over all the different directions in SEPIA. This can
     * be done with the following loop:
     * for(Direction direction : Directions.values())
     *
     * To get the resulting position from a move in that direction you can do the following
     * x += direction.xComponent()
     * y += direction.yComponent()
     * 
     * If you wish to explicitly use a Direction you can use the Direction enum, for example
     * Direction.NORTH or Direction.NORTHEAST.
     * 
     * You can check many of the properties of an Action directly:
     * action.getType(): returns the ActionType of the action
     * action.getUnitID(): returns the ID of the unit performing the Action
     * 
     * ActionType is an enum containing different types of actions. The methods given above
     * create actions of type ActionType.PRIMITIVEATTACK and ActionType.PRIMITIVEMOVE.
     * 
     * For attack actions, you can check the unit that is being attacked. To do this, you
     * must cast the Action as a TargetedAction:
     * ((TargetedAction)action).getTargetID(): returns the ID of the unit being attacked
